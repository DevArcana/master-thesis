  abstract = {As the microblogging services are becoming more prosperous in everyday life for users on Online Social Networks (OSNs), it is more favorable for hot topics and breaking news to gain more attraction very soon than ever before, which are so-called “super-spreading events”. In the information diffusion process of these super-spreading events, messages are passed on from one user to another and numerous individuals are influenced by a relatively small portion of users, a.k.a. super-spreaders. Acquiring an awareness of super-spreading phenomena and an understanding of patterns of wide-ranged information propagations benefits several social media data mining tasks, such as hot topic detection, predictions of information propagation, harmful information monitoring and intervention. Taking into account that super-spreading in both information diffusion and spread of a contagious disease are analogous, in this study, we build a parameterized model, the SAIR model, based on well-known epidemic models to characterize super-spreading phenomenon in tweet information propagation accompanied with super-spreaders. For the purpose of modeling information diffusion, empirical observations on a real-world Weibo dataset are statistically carried out. Both the steady-state analysis on the equilibrium and the validation on real-world Weibo dataset of the proposed model are conducted. The case study that validates the proposed model shows that the SAIR model is much more promising than the conventional SIR model in characterizing a super-spreading event of information propagation. In addition, numerical simulations are carried out and discussed to discover how sensitively the parameters affect the information propagation process.}

  abstract = {There are significant differences between rumor spreading and epidemic spreading in social networks, especially with consideration of the mutual effect of forgetting and remembering mechanisms. In this paper, a new rumor spreading model, Susceptible-Infected-Hibernator-Removed (SIHR) model, is developed. The model extends the classical Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) rumor spreading model by adding a direct link from ignorants to stiflers and a new kind of people-Hibernators. We derive mean-field equations that describe the dynamics of the SIHR model in social networks. Then a steady-state analysis is conducted to investigate the final size of the rumor spreading under various spreading rate, stifling rate, forgetting rate, and average degree of the network. We discuss the spreading threshold and find the relationship between the final size of the rumor and two probabilities. Also Runge–Kutta method is used for numerical simulation which shows that the direct link from the ignorants to the stiflers advances the rumor terminal time and reduces the maximum rumor influence. Moreover, the forgetting and remembering mechanisms of hibernators postpone the rumor terminal time and reduce the maximum rumor influence.}

Agents that read the information but have not decided to spread it, stay in the contacted state. They may become infected or refractory, and both the infected and refractory state are stable. Results show during the evolution process, more contacted agents appear in scale-free networks than in regular lattices. The degree based density of infected agents increases with the degree monotonously, but larger average network degree doesnʼt always mean less relaxation time.}

  abstract  = {Networks provide a ‘skeleton’ for the spread of contagions, like, information, ideas, behaviors and diseases. Many times networks over which contagions diffuse are unobserved and need to be inferred. Here we apply survival theory to develop general additive and multiplicative risk models under which the network inference problems can be solved efficiently by exploiting their convexity. Our additive risk model generalizes several existing network inference models. We show all these models are particular cases of our more general model. Our multiplicative model allows for modeling scenarios in which a node can either increase or decrease the risk of activation of another node, in contrast with previous approaches, which consider only positive risk increments. We evaluate the performance of our network inference algorithms on large synthetic and real cascade datasets, and show that our models are able to predict the length and duration of cascades in real data.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a model for information propagation in a population based on cellular automata. Different to what is commonly used in the models of the area, instead of a binary level for the information, individuals have a level of knowledge. Moreover, the population can have a marketing campaign to help to spread the information with a certain limit due to the consideration of marketing rejection in the model. Numerical simulations show that these campaigns must be wisely set in order to not saturate the population and decrease the marketing balance due to the rejection. The simulation data is statistically analyzed by using principal component analysis in order to identify the most relevant variables for the model output. The conclusion is that dealing with this rejection is difficult, as well as choosing the percentage of the population which will receive the marketing, and along with the weight for the word-of-mouth were the most important variables of the model according to the simulations and the principal component analysis.}

               The event calculus is a formalism for reasoning about action and change. Like the situation calculus, the event calculus has actions, which are called “events,” and time-varying properties or fluents. In the situation calculus, performing an action in a situation gives rise to a successor situation. Situation calculus actions are hypothetical, and time is tree like. In the event calculus, there is a single time line on which actual events occur. A narrative is a possibly incomplete specification of a set of actual event occurrences. The event calculus is narrative based unlike the standard situation calculus in which an exact sequence of hypothetical actions is represented. This chapter discusses several versions of the event calculus, the use of circumscription in the event calculus, methods of knowledge representation using the event calculus, automated event calculus reasoning, and applications of the event calculus. The predicates and functions of the original event calculus are described in the chapter.}
